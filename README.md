# BuyBlack

### BuyBlack is a project that aims to highlight local Black businesses in your area.

## Description

Our project uses Python, CSS, Javascript, Flask and the Jinja templating library to bring into life a website which allows users to look for local black businesses in their area by allowing them to enter a location and the type of Black Owned business they want to search for. We used python and flask to build our project and used jinja templating to obtain greater flexibility and modularity. We used google's places api to search for Black Owned businesses in a specific area. We also provided an easy way of selecting a specific type of business with a pre-defined list of options. We then display the name of the businesses as well as their location together with a google map container with pins of all the Black Businesses listed.
